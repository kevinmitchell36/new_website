            <h4 style="text-align: left;"> Let me tell you how I got there :</h4>
            <br>
            <p>When I was three years old, I would pace around our dinning room table, rambling in toddler gibberish followed by a brief pause, then I would break out in forced laughter. My mom dismissed this as idle chatter until she realized the pattern - I was telling jokes and stories then joining my ‘audience’ in laughter.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I was five years old, I used to lay on the floor with Sesame Street finger puppets on each digit and entertain them with songs and stories. Some where, buried in a photo album, there is incriminating evidence of on of these shows.</p>  
            <br>
            <p>When I was ten years old, I joined a touring choir. I learned how song and dance can tell a story. From Americana folk music that spoke of the distant past to African inspired religious tunes that examined the pulse of a people, I enjoyed each story.</p>   
            <br>
            <p>When I was fifteen, I signed up for my first theater class. I learned how to tell a story through voice, action, and body language.</p>  
            <br>
            <p>When I was nineteen, I started working in restaurants and learned how service and food could tell a story.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And when I started to learn coding, I realized I had new ways of telling stories. What do I want my user to experience when they sign onto my app/website? What story does my code tell when someone pulls my code from GitHub? How can I convey the tale of an entire app just by choosing the right naming conventions?</p>  
            <br>
            <p>Whether you are a small startup or a major tech company, I want to be involved with your story. </p>
